# This code will perform the simple arithmetic calculation of the sum and difference between two numbers.
print(1+2) # This is for an example
print(9-5) # This is also for an example

# The below code fragment will perform some arithmetic calculation
print(1+2) # Output: 3
print(5-4) # Output: 1
print(2*4) # Output: 8
print(6/3) # Output: 2.0
print(3**3) # Output: 27

# You can control the order of operations in long calculations with parenthesis.
# In general, Python follows the PEMDAS rule when deciding the order of operations.
